KaTeX is a fast, easy-to-use JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. It supports much (but not all) of
LaTeX and many LaTeX packages. See the list of [supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

### Syntax

Equations are generally written between the `$` token, or between the `\(` and `\)` tokens:

~~~ .tex
Einstein went on to present his findings mathematically: energy ($E$) equals mass ($m$) times the speed of light ($c$) squared, or $E=mc^2$.
~~~

~~~ .tex
Einstein went on to present his findings mathematically: energy (\(E\)) equals mass (\(m\)) times the speed of light (\(c\)) squared, or \(E=mc^2\).
~~~

Which renders to:

> Einstein went on to present his findings mathematically: energy (&#x24;E&#x24;) equals mass (&#x24;m&#x24;) times the speed of light (&#x24;c&#x24;) squared, or &#x24;E=mc^2&#x24;.

To make a stand-alone equation as a paragraph block, write your equation between the `$$` token, or between the `\[` and
`\]` tokens:

~~~ .tex
$$E=mc^2$$
~~~

~~~ .tex
\[E=mc^2\]
~~~

Which renders to:

> &#x24;&#x24;E=mc^2&#x24;&#x24;

### Notes

#### Markdown

Currently, the `$` and `$$` tokens are safe to delimit the equations in a Markdown document. The alternative syntax
still works, but you have to escape the `\` character twice because Markdown has a special treatment for that character.
KaTeX will start rendering after your Markdown syntax has been converted to HTML.
